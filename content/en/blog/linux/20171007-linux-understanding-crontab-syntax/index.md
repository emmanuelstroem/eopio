What is a Cron?

A Cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix Operating Systems.

It is driven by ```Crontab (cron table)``` - a configuration file that specifies ```shell``` commands to run periodically on a given schedule.

Crontab files are usually stored system-wide in ```/etc``` and only ```sudo``` users can edit.

###### Basic Cron Syntax
    
    * * * * * command_to_execute
    
    e.g:
    30 2 * * * rm /log..txt

This cron job will run everyday at 2:30am and remove the file log.txt from server root.

    * * * * *
    | | | | |___________ day of week (0 - 6) (Saturday to Sunday) (7 is also Sunday on some systems)
    | | | |____________ month (1 -12)
    | | |____________ day of month (1 -31)
    | |____________ hour (0 - 23)
    |____________minute (0 - 59)
    

Looking at another example: ```59 23 31 12 * rm /log..txt```
This cron will be executed _once_ a year on _31st December_ at _11:59 pm_. One minute to every new year.

Standard Characters Allowed in Cron Syntax:
- **Commas (,):** Used to separate items of a list. e.g: Mon,Tue,Wed. Notice the absence of space in the list.
- **Hyphen (-):** Defines ranges. e.g 2017-2025 is every year from 2017 to 2025. Both years inclusive.
- **Percentage (%):** Are changed into newline characters unless escaped by backslash (\). Then all the data after the first ```%``` aare sent to the command as standard inputs.

Non Standard Characters in Cron Syntax:
- **Hash (#):** Only allowed in the day of the month field. Must be followed by a number between 1 and 5. Specifies scenarios such as 2nd Wednesday of the month.
e.g: ```5#3``` implies 3rd Friday of every month.
- **Question Mark (?):** Used instead of ```*``` for blank values. Some Crons substitute this with the startup time of the cron daemon. e.g: ```? ? * * *``` would be updated to ```30 7 * * *``` if the cron daemon started at 7.30am. And would continue to run at this specific time until restarted.
- **Slash (/):** Used to specify step values or intervals. e.g: ```*/5``` in the _minutes_ fields indicates every 5 minuts. shorthand for 5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55,00.
